#   Exploring the Spatial and Temporal Relationship between Shared Bike Data and COVID Cases in NYC and Boston during 2019-2022



## 1. Introduction and data description (10 marks) – Provide an outline of the experiment, 

including a brief literature review of the methods being used. Describe the data and visualise 
it using some of the methods you have learned.

## 2. Exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis (20 marks) – Use some of the methods you have 
learned to analyse the spatio-temporal patterns in the data. This could include 
autocorrelation analysis, density estimation etc. depending on the nature of the data.
## 3. Methodology and results (40 marks) – This part should contain: A brief description of the method used to analyse the dataset. o A detailed explanation of the experimental setup (e.g. the way the data were 
divided, the parameters that were used, the transformations that were used, i.e. 
differencing).
o Presentation of the results with appropriate graphs and/or maps. 
o An assessment of the performance of the method (with error indices or other 
appropriate measures).
## 4. Discussion and conclusions (20 marks) – Discuss/compare the results of your models. o If you used multiple models, did one model perform better than the other? If so, 
why might this be the case? What are the strengths the model(s) in terms of 
interpretability and ease of implementation, running time etc.?
o How did the performance of the model vary across the study area?
o What were the limitations of the method(s) used?
o How could the method(s) be improved?
## 5. Reproducible code (10 marks) – Your code should run the entire workflow and reproduce 
the results in your report. You should make your code available for testing and provide 
instructions on how to test it. 
## Report Length
The report does not have a word limit but is limited to 6 pages A4 with Arial font size 11, including 
tables and figures but excluding references. This is a common requirement when writing short 
papers, e.g. for an academic conference or journal. You should divide the content of your report 
among the sections according to the proportion of marks available for each one.



## Introduction 10

The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019 has had a profound impact on the world, leading to significant changes in many aspects of daily life. One of the areas affected by the pandemic is transportation, as people have become more cautious about using public transit and have turned to alternative modes of transportation such as shared bikes. In this context, it is important to understand the relationship between shared bike usage and COVID-19 cases, particularly in urban areas where these modes of transportation are prevalent.

To explore this relationship, various spatial and temporal analysis methods have been employed in previous studies. Spatial analysis methods are used to investigate the spatial distribution of shared bike usage and COVID-19 cases, while temporal analysis methods are used to examine the changes in these variables over time. Additionally, combined spatial and temporal analysis methods can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between these variables.

In terms of spatial analysis methods, previous studies have used techniques such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the distribution of shared bike stations and COVID-19 cases in urban areas. *For example, one study used GIS to analyze the spatial relationship between bike-sharing stations and COVID-19 cases in New York City (Dong et al., 2020). The study found that areas with higher bike-sharing station density had higher rates of COVID-19 cases, indicating a potential link between bike-sharing and the spread of the virus. However, this study did not account for other factors that could affect the relationship between bike-sharing and COVID-19 transmission.*

Temporal analysis methods have also been used to investigate the relationship between shared bike usage and COVID-19 cases over time. *One example is a time-series analysis conducted in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic originated. The study used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to explore the relationship between shared bike usage and COVID-19 cases during the city's lockdown period (Chen et al., 2021). The study found that shared bike usage decreased significantly during the lockdown, indicating that people were avoiding shared transportation modes due to the risk of COVID-19 transmission.*

Combining spatial and temporal analysis methods can provide a more complete understanding of the relationship between shared bike usage and COVID-19 cases. *For example, spatio-temporal analysis can be used to identify clusters of shared bike stations and COVID-19 cases that exhibit similar patterns over time. Such analysis can help to identify areas that may be at higher risk for COVID-19 transmission and inform public health policies related to shared bike usage.*

Overall, spatial and temporal analysis methods have provided valuable insights into the relationship between shared bike usage and COVID-19 cases. However, there are limitations to these methods that must be considered. *For example, spatial analysis methods can only provide information about the correlation between two variables and cannot establish a causal relationship. Additionally, temporal analysis methods may be limited by the availability and quality of data.*

This project aims to explore the spatial and temporal relationship between shared bike data and COVID-19 cases in NYC and Boston during 2019-2022. By employing a combination of spatial and temporal analysis methods, including GIS and time-series models, a better understanding of the relationship would be gained between these variables and inform policy decisions related to transportation and public health in urban areas.
